                        <li>How do you plant a seedling or sapling?</li>
                        <p class="forLeftAlign">There are actually two major methods of tree planting. One is planting a tree with an intact root ball. The trees can either be bound by fabric and string or potted in a plastic container. </p>
                        <li>When is the season for planting trees?</li>
                        <p class="forLeftAlign"> "Bare-root" tree planting is done during dormant winter months, most often after December 15th but before March 31st.</p>
                        <li>Do I really need to mulch my new tree?</li>
                        <p class="forLeftAlign">New seedlings and saplings need plenty of moisture. Lack of water is the main cause of severe stress to newly planted trees. Mulch is a trees best friend.</p>
                        <li>Where can I buy trees to plant?</li>
                        <p class="forLeftAlign">Trees can be purchased in most states at private, industry and government nurseries.</p>
                        <li>Where should you plant a seedling or sapling?</li>
                        <p class="forLeftAlign">Use common sense when planting a tree. If the tree is expected to grow tall or expand widely give it the room it needs for future growth. Understanding species moisture, light and soil needs is extremely important.</p>
                        <li>How many trees are planted in the United States?</li>
                        <p class="forLeftAlign">Hundreds of nurseries in the United States grow over 1.5 billion trees annually, which reforests nearly three million acres. This number represents over six trees.</p>
